/// This is the model class to handle everything as relate

/// Our data source for this model like with other models shall be a list.
/// It shall accept 3 strings.
/// All our parameters are passed a default value, namely;
/// Unknown sender, Unknown Time, images/portrait_placeholder, etc.
///
/// Ideally the Constructor should always run wih all
/// the necessary parameters so the defaults are never called.
/// The variables are named after what they represent.
